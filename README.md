# Lexical_analysis using C programming
* This is the project done by me to count tokens and NLOC of a sample C code and to display those.</br>
* This project contains 3 files (main.c, code.txt, main.exe) along with this README.md file.</br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;->The main.c file is the source code file which contains code to calculate tokens and to do other tasks.</br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;->The code.txt file is the file which stores the code which main.c will calculate the tokens in it using File Handling Concept.</br> 
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;->The main.exe is an executable file, which is already compiled and shows the output.</br> 
* The source code contains 12 functions and 3 structures.<br>
